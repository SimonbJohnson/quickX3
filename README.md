## HXL Proxy

The default version uses the public version of the HXL proxy hosted at https://proxy.hxlstandard.org/data/source. Files used with HXL Proxy will have to be exposed to the web.

If you are installing a private instance of HXLDash you will also need a private instance of HXL Proxy (https://github.com/HXLStandard/hxl-proxy) accessible to HXLDash.

The following lines of code would have to changed for the new server address:

https://github.com/SimonbJohnson/quickX3/blob/master/hxldash/static/js/dashview.js#L46

These is a issue to parameterise this into the settings file:
